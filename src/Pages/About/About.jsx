        First of all, I would start developing a strong foundation over the core
        fundamentals of web development. Understanding, the core fundamental is
        very important for the journey of becoming a web developer. Then, I
        would apply those fundamental topics/skills to create some projects and
        keep on practicing. Whenever, I'll face errors, I would google the error
        code, keep browsing and keep on solving those errors as much as I can,
        this will lead me to make myself confident enough to move forward and
        grow as a true fullstack web deveeloper.{" "}
